naming boolean things in Go

function:
- question => isValid, isBinarySearchTree
- is(It)Valid, is(It)BinarySearchTree are clearer, but they could get long

variables:
- statement/axiom => endOfMonth, payable
- sometimes can look like questions: isLeapYear
- to make logic clear, it is better to have 1 line per statement/axiom,
  then join together later
