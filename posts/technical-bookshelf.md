Good books

# The Go programming language

![Book cover](https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1426831830l/25080953.jpg)

This is like of the "K&R book" for Go and is a useful reference book for the language.

It has section explain some of the language choice, which helped me appreciate the complexity of
language design. It's also a good reminder of why I need to type so much :)

# Time, Clocks and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System

<https://amturing.acm.org/p558-lamport.pdf>

Classic paper that should be referred to when you are questioning about order of events.

It's more or less a must-read when it comes to distributed systems, as the paper clarifies
the concept of `wall clock`, `partial order`, `concurrency`, etc...

# The C++ Programming Language

![Book cover](https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1347400993l/112251.jpg)

A comprehensive (yet not too long, by C++ standard) book on C++

# Design Data-Intensive Applications

![Book cover](https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1415816873l/23463279.jpg)

A map to the world of databases, message queues and data pipelines.

It presents a high-level overview of data storage and processing systems,
prolems they face at scale as well as approaches to mitigate them.

Since the book touched on concepts of distributed systems & system performance, it's also
a good read if you are into those.

# Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective

![Book cover](https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1387708094l/829182.jpg)

It's a bottom-up book that goes from bits -> program.
This is useful to review how computer actually works,
which will be important when doing scientific computation, debugging or
understanding performance bottlenecks.

It's also a CMU textbook, thus making it even more legitimate.

# Site Reliability Engineering: How Google Runs Production Systems

![Book cover](https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1459115220l/27968891.jpg)

A short intro into what it takes to run reliable software.

# Systems Performance: Enterprise and the Cloud

![Book cover](https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1372681832l/18058001.jpg)

Understand performance, from one of experts in the field.

# Fooled by randomness

![Book cover](https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388180506l/38315.jpg)

Not programming-related, but I feel it's a good read.
I walked away with many concepts on sampling, random distribution, ...
and learned not to try Russian roullete, even if you give me 1-billion dollar to do it!

# Practical Vim: Edit Text at the Speed of Thought

![Book cover](https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1336278962l/13607232.jpg)

Quick intro to Vim, which is my bread and butter now :)

# tmux: Productive mouse-free development

![Book cover](https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1330628877l/13506825.jpg)

Quick intro to Vim, which is my bread and butter now :)


# Reddit: cscareerquestions

Useful read when it comes to interviews, salary negotiation and other workplace problems.

I found a lot anecdotal story of various companies there.
