Mostly harmless book :)

# 1984

![Book cover](https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348990566l/5470.jpg)

A distopia world where surveillance rules. It's alarmingly relevant in the settings of 2018 :(

# Ender's Saga

![Book cover](https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1295660894l/7967.jpg)

Starting off with an interesting war settings, the series shift its perspective to more philosophical and humane ideas at the post-war time.

For me, the idea sums up in this quote from Ender, the main character:

> In the moment when I truly understand my enemy, understand him well enough to defeat him, then in that very moment I also love him. I think itâ€™s impossible to really understand somebody, what they want, what they believe, and not love them the way they love themselves. And then, in that very moment when I love them.... I destroy them

# Old Man's War

![Book cover](https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1487044882l/51964.jpg)

Another military sci-fi :D

There some interesting thoughts in there, but mostly, it's about the battles.

# Search Inside Yourself: The Unexpected Path to Achieving Success, Happiness (And World Peace)

![Book cover](https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1335724389l/12921211.jpg)

Fuss-free mediation, presented in an engineer-friendly format.

# The Art of Insight in Science and Engineering: Mastering Complexity

![Book cover](https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1400838558l/22050657.jpg)

A book on engineering techniques for deadling with complexity, easy to read by hard to conciously practice.

However, it's still a good read for a engineering's mind.

# What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions

![Book cover](https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1451351509l/21413662.jpg)

Probably the more fun and applied version of **The Art of Insight in Science and Engineering**,
presented by the author of `xkcd`
