<p>This is like of the &quot;K&amp;R book&quot; for Go and is a useful reference book for the language.</p>
<p>It has section explain some of the language choice, which helped me appreciate the complexity of language design. It's also a good reminder of why I need to type so much :)</p>
<h1 id="time-clocks-and-the-ordering-of-events-in-a-distributed-system">Time, Clocks and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System</h1>
<p><a href="https://amturing.acm.org/p558-lamport.pdf" class="uri">https://amturing.acm.org/p558-lamport.pdf</a></p>
<p>Classic paper that should be referred to when you are questioning about order of events.</p>
<p>It's more or less a must-read when it comes to distributed systems, as the paper clarifies the concept of <code>wall clock</code>, <code>partial order</code>, <code>concurrency</code>, etc...</p>
<h1 id="the-c-programming-language">The C++ Programming Language</h1>

<p>A comprehensive (yet not too long, by C++ standard) book on C++</p>
<h1 id="design-data-intensive-applications">Design Data-Intensive Applications</h1>
<figure>
<img src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1415816873l/23463279.jpg" alt="Book cover" /><figcaption>Book cover</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A map to the world of databases, message queues and data pipelines.</p>
<p>It presents a high-level overview of data storage and processing systems, prolems they face at scale as well as approaches to mitigate them.</p>
<p>Since the book touched on concepts of distributed systems &amp; system performance, it's also a good read if you are into those.</p>
<h1 id="computer-systems-a-programmers-perspective">Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective</h1>

<img src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1387708094l/829182.jpg" alt="Book cover" /><figcaption>Book cover</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It's a bottom-up book that goes from bits -&gt; program. This is useful to review how computer actually works, which will be important when doing scientific computation, debugging or understanding performance bottlenecks.</p>
<p>It's also a CMU textbook, thus making it even more legitimate.</p>

<p>Not programming-related, but I feel it's a good read. I walked away with many concepts on sampling, random distribution, ... and learned not to try Russian roullete, even if you give me 1-billion dollar to do it!</p>

<p>Useful read when it comes to interviews, salary negotiation and other workplace problems.</p>
<p>I found a lot anecdotal story of various companies there.</p>
