<p>Starting off with an interesting war settings, the series shift its perspective to more philosophical and humane ideas at the post-war time.</p>
<p>For me, the idea sums up in this quote from Ender, the main character:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the moment when I truly understand my enemy, understand him well enough to defeat him, then in that very moment I also love him. I think itâ€™s impossible to really understand somebody, what they want, what they believe, and not love them the way they love themselves. And then, in that very moment when I love them.... I destroy them</p>
