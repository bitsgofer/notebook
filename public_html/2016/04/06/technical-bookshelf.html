			<article><p>Below are a list of books/papers that I found helpful for programming/technical work:</p>

<h2>The Go programming language</h2>

<p><img src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1426831830l/25080953.jpg" alt="Book cover" /></p>

<p>This is like of the &ldquo;K&amp;R book&rdquo; for Go and is a useful reference book for the language.</p>

<p>It has section explain some of the language choice, which helped me appreciate the complexity of
language design. It&rsquo;s also a good reminder of why I need to type so much :)</p>

<h2>Time, Clocks and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System</h2>

<p><a href="https://amturing.acm.org/p558-lamport.pdf">https://amturing.acm.org/p558-lamport.pdf</a></p>

<p>Classic paper that should be referred to when you are questioning about order of events.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s more or less a must-read when it comes to distributed systems, as the paper clarifies
the concept of <code>wall clock</code>, <code>partial order</code>, <code>concurrency</code>, etc&hellip;</p>

<h2>Design Data-Intensive Applications</h2>

<p><img src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1415816873l/23463279.jpg" alt="Book cover" /></p>

<p>A map to the world of databases, message queues and data pipelines.</p>

<p>It presents a high-level overview of data storage and processing systems,
prolems they face at scale as well as approaches to mitigate them.</p>

<p>Since the book touched on concepts of distributed systems &amp; system performance, it&rsquo;s also
a good read if you are into those.</p>

<h2>Computer Systems: A Programmer&rsquo;s Perspective</h2>

<p><img src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1387708094l/829182.jpg" alt="Book cover" /></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a bottom-up book that goes from bits -&gt; program.
This is useful to review how computer actually works,
which will be important when doing scientific computation, debugging or
understanding performance bottlenecks.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also a CMU textbook, thus making it even more legitimate.</p>

<h2>Fooled by randomness</h2>

<p><img src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388180506l/38315.jpg" alt="Book cover" /></p>

<p>Not programming-related, but I feel it&rsquo;s a good read.
I walked away with many concepts on sampling, random distribution, &hellip;
and learned not to try Russian roullete, even if you give me 1-billion dollar to do it!</p>

<h2>Practical Vim: Edit Text at the Speed of Thought</h2>

<p><img src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1336278962l/13607232.jpg" alt="Book cover" /></p>

<p>Quick intro to Vim, which is my bread and butter now :)</p>

<h2>tmux: Productive mouse-free development</h2>

<p><img src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1330628877l/13506825.jpg" alt="Book cover" /></p>

<p>Quick intro to Vim, which is my bread and butter now :)</p>

<h2>Reddit: cscareerquestions</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions">https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions</a></p>

<p>Useful read when it comes to interviews, salary negotiation and other workplace problems.</p>

<p>I found a lot anecdotal story of various companies there.</p>
