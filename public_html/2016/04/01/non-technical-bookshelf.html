			<article><p>These are mostly books that I read for pleasure (mostly <code>sci-fi</code>, <code>fantasy</code> and some <code>non-fiction</code>):</p>

<h2>1984</h2>

<p><img src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348990566l/5470.jpg" alt="Book cover" /></p>

<p>A distopia world where surveillance rules. It&rsquo;s alarmingly relevant in the settings of 2018 :(</p>

<h2>Ender&rsquo;s Saga</h2>

<p><img src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1295660894l/7967.jpg" alt="Book cover" /></p>

<p>Starting off with an interesting war settings, the series shift its perspective to more philosophical and humane ideas at the post-war time.</p>

<p>For me, the idea sums up in this quote from Ender, the main character:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the moment when I truly understand my enemy, understand him well enough to defeat him, then in that very moment I also love him. I think itâ€™s impossible to really understand somebody, what they want, what they believe, and not love them the way they love themselves. And then, in that very moment when I love them&hellip;. I destroy them</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Old Man&rsquo;s War</h2>

<p><img src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1487044882l/51964.jpg" alt="Book cover" /></p>

<p>Another military sci-fi :D</p>

<p>There some interesting thoughts in there, but mostly, it&rsquo;s about the battles.</p>

<h2>Search Inside Yourself: The Unexpected Path to Achieving Success, Happiness (And World Peace)</h2>

<p><img src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1335724389l/12921211.jpg" alt="Book cover" /></p>

<p>Fuss-free mediation, presented in an engineer-friendly format.</p>

<h2>The Art of Insight in Science and Engineering: Mastering Complexity</h2>

<p><img src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1400838558l/22050657.jpg" alt="Book cover" /></p>

<p>A book on engineering techniques for deadling with complexity, easy to read by hard to conciously practice.</p>

<p>However, it&rsquo;s still a good read for a engineering&rsquo;s mind.</p>

<h2>What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions</h2>

<p><img src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1451351509l/21413662.jpg" alt="Book cover" /></p>

<p>Probably the more fun and applied version of <strong>The Art of Insight in Science and Engineering</strong>,
presented by the author of <code>xkcd</code></p>
